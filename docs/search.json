    "text": "We describe here the format of the various data types found in the database. Below we detail\n\nMolecular orbital data, in NIST_orbitals/ and full_orbitals/\nIonization cross sections, in ion_xs/\nAstrochemical network files, in networks/\n\n\nOrbital data\nThe orbital information is stored in two directories containing the orbitals in the NIST format, NIST_orbitals/ and including all orbitals, full_orbitals/. An example of the NIST formatted file, NIST_oribtals/co.norb:\n #CO NIST Orbitals\n #Orbital      B            U      N Q\n 1        562.416986   794.326705  2    1\n 2        309.246847   436.294142  2    1\n 3         41.332626    78.262641  2    1\n 4         21.888866    71.857734  2    1\n 5         17.015000    53.945104  2    1\n 6         17.015000    53.945104  2    1\n 7         14.266000    42.788163  2    1\nwhere the B column gives the eBE (eV), U gives the average electron kinetic energy (eV), N gives the orbital occupation number and Q is a scaling factor to include higher-order ionization effects. These files can be directly and more readily used to compute the BEB cross sections.\nAn example of a full orbital file, which provides more complete information, is full_orbitals/co.forb:\n #CO Full Orbitals\n #Alpha orbitals\n #Orb.         KE       BE-HF   BE-P3+     Pole\n    1   794.32671   562.41699      ***      ***\n    2   436.29414   309.24685      ***      ***\n    3    78.26264    41.33263      ***      ***\n    4    71.85773    21.88887      ***      ***\n    5    53.94510    17.35920   17.015    0.903\n    6    53.94510    17.35920   17.015    0.903\n    7    42.78816    15.11922   14.266    0.910\nwhere the file will give the information for both alpha and beta orbitals, for open-shell molecules that were computed with an unrestricted formalism. The KE and BE-HF columns give the average electron kinetic energy and eBE (eV) computed by the population analysis in {Gaussian16} following geometry optimization. The latter 2 columns include the results from EPT, where *** denotes orbitals where EPT was not computed. For orbitals where it was computed, we include the EPT-corrected HF canonical orbital energies (at P3+ level) results and the pole strength (PS). For the NIST orbital file, we include the BE-P3+ in the PS &gt; 0.8, following recommendation from Gaussian.\n\n\nCross-section data\nCross sections are found in the ion_xs/ directories for the SCAR, HF, MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations and atoms. Cross-section files in these folders are formatted as in the following example, ion_xs/mp2/CO.xs:\n # CO cross section\n 256\n 1.00000e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n 1.04618e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n 1.09450e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n 1.14505e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n 1.19793e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n 1.25325e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n 1.31113e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n 1.37169e+01     0.00000e+00     0.00000e+00\n                 {more data}\n 9.13659e+05     8.52230e-03     6.30487e-03\n 9.55855e+05     8.17497e-03     6.04801e-03\n 1.00000e+06     7.84171e-03     5.80155e-03\nwhere the first row gives the number of electron energy bins. The later rows give the data in (two) three columns. For BEB cross sections, the columns provide electron impact energy (eV), BEB cross section in units of \\(\\sigma_0^2\\) and, if available, the damped-BEB cross section in units of \\(\\sigma_0^2\\). For SCAR cross sections, the two columns provide energy (eV) and SCAR cross section in units of \\(\\sigma_0^2\\).\nWe also provide a folder called recommended/ which provides a single file for each molecular in the database. These are formatted as above with two columns, as in ion_xs/recommended/CO.xs:\n# CO cross section\n256\n1.00000e+01 0.00000e+00\n1.04618e+01 0.00000e+00\n1.09450e+01 0.00000e+00\n1.14505e+01 0.00000e+00\n1.19793e+01 0.00000e+00\n1.25325e+01 0.00000e+00\n1.31113e+01 0.00000e+00\n1.37169e+01 0.00000e+00\n      {more data}\n9.13659e+05 8.52230e-03\n9.55855e+05 8.17497e-03\n1.00000e+06 7.84171e-03\n\n\nAstrochemical network files\nWe provide reaction rate files for all molecules in two common astrochemical network formats:\n\nKIDA (for Kinetic Database for Astrochemistry). The network formats are described in the KIDA presentation paper, Wakelam et al. (2012), see also their website.\nUMIST Database for Astrochemistry (UDfA, or more commonly UMIST, sometimes referenced as RateXX, where XX is the year of the release). See their website for formatting.\n\n\nNote of caution. When including these ionization processes in astrochemical networks, ensure that the network not only includes the molecular ion, but also the recombination rate. Failure to do this will create species with only sources but no important sinks!\n\nWe are currently working with KIDA to get all reaction rate data to be included in their online database."

In detail, the database has geometries optimized at the HF/aug-cc-pVTZ (hf/), MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ (mp2/) and CCSDT(T)-F12 (ccsdt/) levels.\nThe MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations were performed specifically for the database. For these, the initial structures are taken from NIST Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (CCCBDB) database or ChemSpider. In total, about 150 molecules were computed with MP2 and 140 with CCSD(T) (not all of these have had binding energies computed).\nThe HF geometries were computed in Heathcote & Valance (2018) and Zhou et al. (2019).\nFor orbitals with binding energies less than about 20 eV, the electron binding energy (eBE), \\(B_\\ell\\), taken as the negative of the energy of orbital \\(\\ell\\), is computed by means of electron propagator theory (EPT) in its P3+ implementation. In EPT, electron correlation is taken into account, thus providing a more accurate value for \\(B_\\ell\\), compared to Hartree-Fock (HF) canonical orbital energies.\nThe MP2 and HF calculations were performed with the Gaussian code (Gaussian 16 and Gaussian 09), respectively. The CCSD(T) data were computed with Molpro, and Psi4, interfaced with the QCFractal infrastructure.",

    "title": "Semi-empirical cross sections",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Binary-encounter Bethe (BEB)\nThe semi-empirical binary-encounter Bethe (BEB) cross section was developed as a simplification of the binary-encounter dipole cross section of Kim & Rudd (1994) and Hwang et al. (1994). This cross section has been found to provide a reasonable match with experimental data, and requires only knowledge of the molecular orbital energies. BEB cross section are the base of numerous cross-section databases, in particular the NIST database. The BEB cross section is defined as:\n\\[\n    \\sigma_{m, {\\rm BEB}} = \\sum_{\\ell}  \\left [ \\frac{S_\\ell}{t_\\ell + (u_\\ell + 1)}\\right ] \\Biggl [ \\frac{\\ln t_\\ell}{2} \\left ( 1 - \\frac{1}{t_\\ell^2} \\right ) +  \\left ( 1 - \\frac{1}{t_\\ell} - \\frac{\\ln t_\\ell}{t_\\ell + 1}\\right ) \\Biggr ],\n\\]\nwhere the sum is over orbitals, indexed \\(\\ell\\), \\(t_\\ell =  E_e/B_\\ell\\), \\(u_\\ell = U_\\ell/B_\\ell\\) and \\(S_\\ell = 4\\pi a_0^2 n_\\ell \\left ( \\frac{R_{\\infty}}{B_\\ell}\\right )^2\\). Here, \\(B_\\ell\\) and \\(U_\\ell\\) are the orbital binding and orbital kinetic energies of the ejected electron, respectively, \\(n_\\ell\\) is the orbital occupation number, and \\(R_{\\infty}\\) is the Rydberg constant. The parameters \\(B_\\ell\\) and \\(U_\\ell\\) are generally computed using electronic structure methods.\nThe database also includes a modified version of the BEB cross section (dBEB) to dampen the impact of orbitals with binding energies greater than the ionization potential. In dBEB cross-section formulation, the \\(B_\\ell\\) is scaled by an exponential function such that the modified binding energy of orbital \\(\\ell\\) is given by: \\[\n    B_\\ell^\\prime = B_\\ell e^{-(1 - B_\\ell/{\\rm IP})},\n\\]\nIn general, BEB cross sections underpredict experimental results at higher energies since they only account for single ionizations, while experimental data, where the measured signal is generally the ion current, includes contributions from multiple ionization events which contribute more to the measured signal per event than single ionizations.\nFuture updates to the database will utilize the relativistic formalism of the BEB/\n\n\nScreening-correcting additivity rule (SCAR)\nThe Screening-corrected additivity rule (SCAR) of Blanco & Garcia (2003) and Blanco et al. (2010) enables the quick computation of molecular cross sections using just a pre-computed basis of electron-atom ionization cross sections. The only required molecular data is an optimized geometry, which are more readily available from online databases compared to the molecular orbitals. SCAR is an additivity rule which takes into account the effective geometrical overlap of the atomic electron cross sections. The cross section for a specific molecule, \\(m\\), is given by \\[\n    \\sigma_{m, {\\rm SCAR}}(E) = \\sum_i s_i \\sigma_i(E),\n\\] where the sum is carried out over all constituent atoms and \\(\\sigma_i(E)\\) is the electron-atom ionization cross section for atom, \\(i\\). The additivity coefficients, \\(s_i\\), are \\[\ns_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_k} \\frac{\\left ( -1\\right )^{k+1} \\varepsilon_i^{(k)}}{k!},\n\\] where \\(N_k\\) is the number of perturbation terms included. The coefficients, \\(\\varepsilon_i^{(k)}\\), follow a recursion relation \\[\n\\varepsilon_i^{(1)} = 1\n\\] \\[\n\\varepsilon_i^{(k)} = \\frac{N_k - k + 1}{N_k - 1} \\sum_{\\rm j(\\neq i)} \\frac{\\sigma_j \\varepsilon_j^{(k-1)}}{\\alpha_{ji}}\\,, k = 2,\\ldots,N\\,,\n\\] where \\(\\alpha_{ji} = \\max(4\\pi r_{ij}^2, \\sigma_i, \\sigma_j)\\), and \\(r_{ij}\\) is the distance between atoms \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). The terms in the recursive relation account for the overlap of the cross sections of all the individual items. Due to the recursive nature, including higher-order correction terms leads to an exponential increase in computational cost. For the cross sections in this database, we only include upto 6-atom screening, as highe order factors were found to be less important for the moelcules in the database.",

The cross sections were calculated following the Binary-encounter Bethe (BEB) formalism using optimize molecule geometries and electronic structures computed using the Gaussian16 and MolPro codes. The initial release also includes computed ionization potentials for most of the molecules, computed at two different levels of theory: CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ+CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/CBS.\n\nEvaluations of ionization potentials can vary drastically between each other, and for many molecules experimental values vary as well. We suggest those interested in the ionization potentials to also consult the NIST Chemistry WebBook.\n\nIn the database we also include the optimized geometries and computed electron orbitals. The orbitals can be used to recompute the BEB cross sections in applications as desired, with the format in NIST_orbitals/ matching that in the NIST database.\n\nUsing the orbitals directly is preferable for those wishing to use the cross sections outside the energy range in the raw data, to avoid extrapolation issues. We have added a notebook in the scripts/ folder to demonstrate this.\n\nFinally, we include chemical networks for the ionization chemistry in both the UMIST and KIDA formats.",

    "text": "Definition of an ionization rate and ionization rate coefficient\nFor the purposes of astrochemical cosmic-ray ionization rates, for a slab geometry, we define an ionization rate of some molecule, \\(m\\), by impacting particle, \\(i\\), as \\[\n\\zeta_m = 2 \\pi \\int j_i(E_i) \\sigma_{m, {\\rm ion}}(E_i) dE_i.\n\\] For three-dimensional geometries, the prefactor in front is usually replaced by \\(4\\pi\\).\nThe above expression works if you have knowledge of the spectrum. However, in most astrochemical applications, the user instead only provides an ionization rate of either atomic or molecular hydrogen. These can either be just the so-called “primary” ionization rate, which accounts only for primary protons, or the “total” ionization rate which includes both primary protons and secondary electrons, or sometimes also primary electrons. In a particular astrochemical network, the rates are then given as \\[\n\\zeta_m = \\alpha_m \\zeta_0\n\\] where \\(\\zeta_0\\) is a given reference rate, which may depend on the database used. Therefore, the user should be careful which ionization rate is used in both the chemistry and heating in their code. In our database, we report the \\(\\alpha_m\\) (denoted \\(c_{m, T}\\) in the paper) using the total ionization rate including both protons and electrons, with the reference value is the total ionization rate of molecular hydrogen, H2. See review in the chapter Cosmic rays: physics, chemistry, and computational challenges Padovani & Gaches (2023), in the recent (and highly recommended) book Astrochemical Modeling: Practical Aspects of Microphysics in Numerical Simulations.\n\n\nIrradiation fluxes used in the database\nThe primary interest of this database is for astrochemical modeling, which generally normalized the ionization rates to reference interstellar mediun (ISM) rates.\nFor computing the above ionization rates, we use both a primary proton and primary electron interstellar spectrum which reproduces diffuse ISM inferred ionization rates (Padovani et al. 2018). Secondary electrons are computing following the more rigorous and complete theory from Ivlev et al. (2021) including important losses from vibrational H2 excitations (see Padovani et al. 2022). We include the depth-depending ionization rates, and then average over typical depths of molecular clouds.\n\n\nDepth-dependent ionization rates\nThe depth-dependent electron ionization rate of a molecule, \\(m\\), is given by adding the contributions of primary protons, \\(\\zeta_{p, m}(N_{\\rm H_2})\\), using the approximation \\({m_e}E_p \\approx {m_p}E_e\\),\n\\[\n    \\zeta_{p,m}(N_{\\rm H_2}) = 2\\pi \\int j_{p}(E_p, N_{\\rm H_2}) \\,\\sigma_{m}\\left[(m_e/m_p) E_p\\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}E_p,\n\\] primary electrons, \\[\n    \\zeta_{e,m}(N_{\\rm H_2}) = 2\\pi \\int j_{e}(E_e, N_{\\rm H_2}) \\,\\sigma_{m}(E_e)\\,\\mathrm{d}E_e,\n\\] and secondary electrons from both primary protons and electrons \\[\n    \\zeta_{se,m}(N_{\\rm H_2}) = 4\\pi \\int j_{se}(E_e, N_{\\rm H_2}) \\,\\sigma_{m}(E_e)\\,\\mathrm{d}E_e,\n\\] where \\(se\\) represents secondary electrons. The factors of \\(2\\pi\\) and \\(4\\pi\\) account for fluxes which are assumed to be plane parallel and isotropic, respectively. The total ionization rate for a molecule is then, \\(\\zeta_{m} = \\zeta_{p,m} + \\zeta_{e,m} + \\zeta_{se,m}\\). The factor of \\(4\\pi\\) comes from treating the secondary electrons as an isotropic local source.\nThe column-dependent total ionization rate coefficient for species \\(m\\), \\(c_{m, T}(N_{\\rm H_2})\\) is \\[\n    \\zeta_{m, T}(N_{\\rm H_2}) = c_{m, T}(N_{\\rm H_2})\\,\\zeta_{{\\rm H_2},T}(N_{\\rm H_2}).\n\\]\nThis is computed for a sample of column densities from \\(N({\\rm H_2}) = 10^{20} - 10^{23}\\) cm-2. The average rate coefficient reported in the database is \\[\n\\alpha_m = \\bar{c}_{m, T} = \\langle c_{m, T}(N_{\\rm H_2}) \\rangle.\n\\]",
